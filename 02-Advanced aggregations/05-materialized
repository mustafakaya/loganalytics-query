// Allows caching a sub-query result during the time of query execution in a way that other subqueries can reference the partial result.
// This can be done using batches 

// Useful also in scenarios when we need to join/union fork legs.

// Materialize is allowed to be used only in let statements by giving the cached result a name.

// Materialize has a cache size limit which is 5 GB.
