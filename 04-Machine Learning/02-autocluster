// autocluster looks for common patterns of discrete attributes in the data
// and reduces it to just a small number of patterns. 
// While the Basket command finds all frequent patterns in data, 
// Autocluster finds frequent patterns in the data and reduces the results to a smaller number of patterns.
// This works well for analyzing data like Event Logs to focus on more frequent patterns.
