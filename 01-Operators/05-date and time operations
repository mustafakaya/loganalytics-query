// To get the number of events that occurred every 5 minutes during the last one hour:
Event
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| summarize events_count=count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)

// Another way to create buckets of results is to use functions, such as startofday:
Event
| where TimeGenerated > ago(4d)
| summarize events_count=count() by startofday(TimeGenerated)

// time zones
Event
| extend localTimestamp = TimeGenerated - 8h
